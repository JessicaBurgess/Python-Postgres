# Python-Postgres
Project uses python script to download a dataset. It then connects to PostgreSQL to create a table and load the data into it.

The project will prompt a user to input a year and state name. It then runs a PostgreSQL query to find the leading causes of death for that given state and year. 

The 'Cause Of Death' file runs project in Jupyter Notebooks
